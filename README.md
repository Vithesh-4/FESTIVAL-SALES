# FESTIVAL-SALES

In the festival sales data analysis we have exclusively used EDA and found out the direction of sales, who were purchasing more and which gender etc.
The python libraries were used for data visualization and analysis, also data cleaning and manipulation was done.
The customer were easily identified across different states, occupationn,gender and age gropus.
The sales were improved by analysing the most sold products and hence the inventory and demands can be met.
